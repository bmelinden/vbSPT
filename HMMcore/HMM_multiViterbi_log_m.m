% function S=HMM_multiViterbi_log_m(lnQ,lnH,iEnd) 
% most likely trajectories by the Viterbi algorithm, using a one-array
% representation of many trajectories, and the log of transition
% matrix lnQ and emission likelihood lnH. This is the matlab version of
% HMM_multiViterbi_log.c, created for debugging purposes, but very much
% slower.
