vbSPT is a program suite for analysis of single particle diffusion
trajectories, where the diffusion constants switch randomly according
to a discrete Markov process. The program runs on Matlab, but uses
compiled C-code to speed up the most computer intensive loops.
The latest version of the software as well as a forum for discussion and 
questions can be found at 'sourceforge.net/projects/vbspt/'.
