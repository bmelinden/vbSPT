function est=VB3_parameterEstimates(M)
% est=VB3_parameterEstimates(M)
% generate some estimates based on a M-field. Good for interpreting various
% 'true' models, e.g., those generated by knowing the hidden states etc.
% M : input M field of some model
% est : those parameter estimates that can be done based on the M field
% alone, same as done by VB3_VBEMiterator
