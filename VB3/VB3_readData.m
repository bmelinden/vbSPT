function X=VB3_readData(runinput)
% X=VB3_readData(runinput)
% 
% Read diffusion data set as specified in a runinputfile. It is also possible
% to use an options structure, e.g., from opt=VB3_getOptions(runinputfile) instead.
% Only trajectories longer than trjLmin (specified in opt) are returned. 
%

% ML 2014-07-10 : handle runinput files without the .m suffix
