function W1=VB3_sortModel(W,ind)
% W1=VB3_sortModel(W,ind)
%
% sort the states of the VB3 model W in order ind, where in is a
% permutation of 1:W.N. If ind is not given, the model is sorter in order
% of increasing most likely diffusion constant, 
% W.est.DdtMode=W.M.c/4./(W.M.n+1)
%
% Only the M,PM, and est fields are sorted, other fields must be recreated
% by running further VB iterations.
