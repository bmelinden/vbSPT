function [x,s]=VB3_switching_diffusion_ddim(A,g,T,d)
% [x,s]=VB3_switching_diffusion_ddim(A,g,T,d)
%
% simulate hidden states s(t) and position x(t) for a diffusion that
% switches between different diffusion constant according to a Markov
% process. Displaced so that x(1)=0;
%
% A(i,j)=p(s_t=j|s_{t-1}=i), so the evolution of the hidden states is
% given by p(t)=p(t-1)*A, where p(t) is a row vector
%
% g is a vector of precision parameters: if s(t)=i, then 
% 2*D(i)*dt = Var[x(t+1)-x(t)] = 1/2/g(i). 
%
% d is the dimension of the output data (default:2)
%
% T is the number of time points to simulate.
