\texttt{timestep}						&	  real								&		Timestep between points in the trajectories, in units of [time].\\ [0.5ex]  \hline 
\texttt{dim}								&	  int							&		Dimensionality of the data to be analysed (the first dim columns in the coordinate data will be used).\\ [0.5ex]  \hline 
\texttt{trjLmin}						&	  int									&		Minimum length of trajectories to be included in the analysis. Recommended default value: 2.\\ [0.5ex]  \hline 
\texttt{runs}							&	  int								&		Number of analysis attempts at each model size. Recommended to use a multiple of the number of cores when running in parallel.\\ [0.5ex]  \hline 
\texttt{maxHidden}					&	  int								&		Maximum number of hidden states to consider. Recommended to use twice the amount of expected hidden states.\\ [0.5ex]  \hline 
\texttt{maxIter}						&	  int									&		Maximum number of VB iterations. Set to an empty matrix (\texttt{[]}) to use the recommended default value of 1000.\\ [0.5ex]  \hline 
\texttt{relTolF}						&	  real									&		Convergence criterion for the relative change in likelihood lower bound. Recommended to set to \texttt{[]}, which uses the default value of $10^{-8}$.\\[0.5ex]  \hline 
\texttt{tolPar}							&	  real									&		Convergence criterion for the M-step parameters. Recommended to set to \texttt{[]}, which uses the default value of $10^{-2}$.\\[0.5ex]  \hline

\texttt{est2.sMaxP}			& The sequence of most likely hidden states for each trajectory. The est2 field is only computed if \texttt{stateEstimate=true;} is given in the runinput file (equivalent of choosing 'Additional estimates' in the GUI) since it is rather large and computer intensive. \\[1ex] % [1ex] adds vertical space
